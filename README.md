Test task: Make sticky Header, which will be supported in all browsers.

You can see my decision in a file src/js/sticky.js

This time I din't use any libraries.

I use npm  and Webpack build tool.

You need Nodejs install on your machine.

To run the project You should make 3 steps using command line:

npm install    (to install dependencies in node_modules folder)

npm run dev-server         (to run the project)

And open it in the browser  http://localhost:8080
